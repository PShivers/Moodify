# Moodify

This project is made to automate playlists depending on the current weather in your area.

## Technologies

It is currently being built using React/HTML/CSS
It is also using WeatherAPI.com and Spotify's API.
In the future I hope to add a python/django backend to allow for user login.
This will allow persistence of search histories and previously compiled playlists.
